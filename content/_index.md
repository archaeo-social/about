The archaeo.social initiative is a network of open, decentralised social media services for archaeology.
We use free and open source software to promote a 'do it yourself' approach to scholarly communication and lessen the field's dependence on centralised, proprietary platforms.

We currently offer:

* [archaeo.social](https://archaeo.social) – federated micro-blogging with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
* [chat.archaeo.social](https://chat.archaeo.social) – instant messaging with [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Element](https://element.io/)

archaeo.social is currently maintained by [Joe Roe](https://joeroe.io) as a personal project.
As the network grows, we will explore options for institutional and/or cooperative support.
