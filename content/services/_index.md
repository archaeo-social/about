The archaeo.social collective maintains a network of open, federated social media services for archaeology.
We use free and open source software to promote a 'do it yourself' approach to scholarly communication and lessen the field's dependence on centralised, proprietary platforms.

We currently offer:

* [archaeo.social](https://archaeo.social) – federated micro-blogging with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
* [chat.archaeo.social](https://chat.archaeo.social) – instant messaging with [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Element](https://element.io/)
* [archaeoring](https://webring.archaeo.social) – an old-school [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) for archaeology blogs and personal websites
* [archaeo.dev](/dev/) – experimental tools for collaboration and research software development

These services are maintained by [Joe Roe](https://archaeo.social/@joeroe) with support from volunteer moderators and [contributors on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/archaeosocial).

All our services are hosted in Europe.
