archaeo.dev is an experiment in collective hosting of collaboration and software developments tools for archaeological research.
Its aim is to reduce the field's dependence on centralised, proprietary services such as GitHub or cloud-based collaborative editing suites.
We are currently trialling:

* <https://forge.archaeo.dev> - git repository host based on [ForgeJo](https://forgejo.org/)
* <https://md.archaeo.dev> - collaborative note-taking and writing in Markdown format, powered by [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/)

These tools are relatively expensive to host and so are expected to be closed registration, available to users who [contribute financially](https://opencollective.com/archaeosocial) to the archaeo.social collective (on a 'pay what you can' basis).

If you are interested in helping us test and develop these tools, please contact us at <admin@archaeo.social> or via Matrix at [#archaeo-dev:archaeo.social](https://matrix.to/#/#archaeo-dev:archaeo.social).
